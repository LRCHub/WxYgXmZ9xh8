[00:04.31] Ten after one I think I'll hop the horse
[00:40.60] Downtown late of three of course
[00:43.45] Just came from fishing couldn't get a catch
[00:45.82] Downtown they'll probably have a batch
[00:47.72] A whiting sandwich and a Guinness Stout
[00:50.04] But with the beer though I had a bout
[00:52.28] So I exchanged it for some apple juice
[00:54.54] I had the blues but I shook them loose
[00:57.48] A jeep is blasting from the urban streets
[00:59.34] Loots of funk over hardcore beats
[01:01.34] The moon dabbles in the morning sky
[01:04.49] As the minutes just creep on by
[01:06.99] I get a thought and hear comes my Tribe
[01:09.25] Ritual shakes and in good vibes
[01:11.94] Like always the Quest begins
[01:14.31] In the mist though but the rhyth's move in
[01:17.23] We find a spot and we sit and chat
[01:19.06] Speaking on the status quo of rap
[01:21.35] A derelick makes a real long speach
[01:23.45] We pay attention to the words he read
[01:25.80] When he was done we rattled on
[01:27.86] There was no lunch because it wasn't dawn
[01:30.30] We pointed things out about this times
[01:32.79] The worlds famons and the crazy crimes
[01:35.26] Inflation of the nation, it bothers me
[01:37.78] I better go gold, to pay the taxes
[01:40.47] Gotta be swift society
[01:42.42] The man whose made is the man who maxes
[01:45.32] The grounds for living are being discussed
[01:47.47] As we go it gets close to dusk
[01:49.96] Gather thoughts and savor breath
[01:52.34] Cause there's only a few hours left
[02:09.84] 
[01:55.36] After Hours it was cool
[02:04.81] After Hours it was cool
[02:05.66] After Hours it was cool
[02:08.58] After Hours it was cool
[02:10.06] After Hours it was cool
[02:11.25] After Hours it was cool
[02:12.23] After Hours it was cool
[02:13.04] After Hours it was cool
[02:24.54] 
[02:14.20] Me ohh my, hey-hey, hey-hey
[02:36.28] The human hours are here to stay
[02:38.14] This is how it seems(?) my witness
[02:40.49] Bug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this
[02:42.94] Girls be screaming on this conversation
[02:45.28] I have my two cents for a revelation
[02:47.81] And my watch continuously tic-tocs
[02:50.06] Shaheed will bring up the beats that rocks
[02:52.45] I hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles
[02:55.06] A car revs up and I hear it trottle
[02:57.02] It probably moves with the morning wind
[02:59.45] Ohh my God, here's Phife again
[03:01.73] (?) talking about last nights game
[03:04.22] Trying to remember someone's name
[03:06.74] So hear the frogs dancing in the streets
[03:09.10] Once again Ali will bring up the beat
[03:12.00] Like this
[03:16.50] 
[03:17.61] The beat is over and so is the night
[03:32.82] The sun is risen and the shine is bright
[03:35.43] We all say peace and go our separate ways
[03:38.49] Youth is fading as we gain our days
[03:40.78] Explanation for the song is simp'
[03:42.77] The hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp
[03:45.25] As we go you hear a gasp of laugh
[03:47.60] As we start up our rhythmic path
[03:50.23] Like this
[03:54.73] 
[03:53.64] After Hours it was cool
[03:56.26] After Hours it was cool
[04:00.09] After Hours it was cool
[04:04.38] After Hours it was cool
[04:09.10] After Hours it was cool
[04:13.69] After Hours it was cool
[04:18.46] After Hours it was cool
[04:23.24] After Hours it was cool
