We like it when it lasts
We drive it really fast
It's been a long time
Since I have opened wide

It's the thrill

But we just seek a thrill
Like chasing the mill
You're working too hard
And then those problems start

I'm not gonna say too much
I've said it enough
I wanna feel it again
Seek a thrill
Don't throw it away

Don't throw it away
(Away)
Don't throw it away
It's the thrill
It's the thrill

Last night I had a dream
That everything just stopped
The thrill of that thought
Starts counting down the clock

And now I pour a fire
Over something I desire
And now I pour a fire
Over something I desire

Nothing I can do
To stop me from feelin' so blue
I wanna feel it again
Seek a thrill
Don't throw it away

Don't throw it away
(Away)
Don't throw it away

It's the thrill
(Don't throw it away)
Look out ladies, it's the thrill
It's the thrill
