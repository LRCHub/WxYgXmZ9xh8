Thought I almost died
in my dream again
(Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life,
I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' into you (Oh)
Without you goin' smooth
(Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I won't choose to leave
This time I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I'm asleep
It's on me, only me, oh
Talk to me,
without you I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Fell apart from a lonely time
in this crowded room
Different girls on the floor,
distracting my thoughts of you
I turned into the man
I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you
inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up
'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you
and say, and say
Oh, baby, where are you now
when I need you most?
I'd give it all
just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart,
your heart
Never come and go
I was runnin' away
from base of reality
Wastin' all of my time
on livin' my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate,
compensate
'Cause I want you baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven
when I'm inside of you
Can't resent when I'm blessed,
I wake up beside you
I'll never let you down again,
again
Oh, baby, where are you now
when I need you most?
I'd give it all
just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart,
your heart
I said, baby, I treat you
better than I did before
I hold you down,
when I let you go
This time I won't break
your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
I said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you,
I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth,
I stayed with her
in spite of you
You did some things
that you regret,
still right for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby,
where are you now
when I need you most?
I give it all
just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart,
your heart
And I said, baby, I'll treat you
better than I did before
I hold you down,
when I let you go
This time I won't break
your heart, your heart, no
