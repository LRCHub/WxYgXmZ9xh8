I ran off to Paris
Looking for something new
Went all the way around the world
Just to come back to you

In between connections
Tried to call you yesterday
Operator told me
That our love has been delayed, yeah

After hours
I'll be waiting
We'll do what we want to
(Anything we want to)

After hours
Give you my heart
After hours
Nothing's gonna keep us apart

In my imagination
I could swear that I'm in love with you
Now it's time to draw the line
Tell you what I'm gonna do, ooh

Headed your direction
On my way back to L.A
I'll see you after hours
Don't know just how long I can stay
Oh, yeah

After hours
I'll be waiting
We'll do what we want to
(Anything we want to)

After hours
Give you my heart
After hours
Nothing's gonna keep us apart

After hours
I'll be waiting
We'll do what we want to
(Anything we want to, yeah)

After hours
Give you my heart
After hours
Nothing's gonna keep us apart

After hours
After hours
Nothing's gonna keep us apart
After hours
After hours
Anything we want to, yeah

After hours, oooh-oooh
After hours
Give you all my heart, yeah
After hours
Nothing's gonna keep us apart

After hours
